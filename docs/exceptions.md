# Exceptions

Exception management allows you to formally record and track waivers granted when a security control cannot be implemented in accordance with requirements. An exception is linked to a non-compliant control and follows an approval workflow handled by an administrator.

## Exception list {#list}

This screen displays the list of exceptions and allows you to filter them by:

* status (Draft, Submitted, Approved, Rejected, Expired);

* linked control;

* expired exceptions only.

Overdue end dates are displayed in red.

Clicking on a row takes you to the [exception details screen](#show).

The "New" button is available to users with the **Administrator** or **User** role.

## View an exception {#show}

This screen displays the information for an exception:

* The exception name;

* The current status;

* The linked control (with a link to the corresponding [security measure](measures.en.md/#show));

* The exception description;

* The business justification;

* Any compensating controls;

* The validity period (start date and end date);

* The creator and creation date;

* The submitter and submission date;

* The decision (approver, date and comment).

The buttons available depend on the exception status and the user's role:

| Button | Condition |
|---|---|
| "Submit" | Draft status — Administrator or User |
| "Edit" | Draft or Rejected status — Administrator or User |
| "Delete" | Administrator only |
| "Approve" | Submitted status — Administrator only |
| "Reject" | Submitted status — Administrator only |

Clicking on:

* "Submit" moves the exception to *Submitted* status and sends it for approval by an administrator;

* "Edit" takes you to the [exception edit screen](#edit);

* "Delete" deletes the exception and takes you back to the [exception list](#list);

* "Approve" accepts the exception and moves it to *Approved* status;

* "Reject" rejects the exception (a reason is mandatory) and moves it to *Rejected* status;

* "Cancel" takes you back to the [exception list](#list).

## Create an exception {#create}

From the [exception list](#list), the "New" button opens the creation form.

This screen contains the following fields:

* The exception name;

* The linked control (the non-compliant security measure that is the source of the waiver);

* The exception description;

* The business justification (the reason why the control cannot be implemented);

* Compensating controls (alternative controls put in place to reduce the residual risk);

* The validity start date and end date.

An exception is created with **Draft** status. It must be explicitly submitted before it can be reviewed by an administrator.

Clicking on:

* "Save" records the exception and takes you to the [exception details screen](#show);

* "Cancel" takes you back to the [exception list](#list).

## Edit an exception {#edit}

This screen allows you to edit an exception with **Draft** or **Rejected** status.

A rejected exception that is edited automatically reverts to *Draft* status so that it can be corrected and resubmitted.

This screen contains the same fields as the [creation screen](#create). The current status and any rejection reason are displayed as read-only for reference.

Clicking on:

* "Save" records the changes and takes you to the [exception details screen](#show);

* "Cancel" takes you back to the [exception details screen](#show).

## Approval workflow {#workflow}

The lifecycle of an exception follows these steps:

```
Draft → Submitted → Approved
                ↘ Rejected → (re-edit) → Draft
Approved → Expired  (automatic, when the end date has passed)
```

* **Draft**: the exception is being written. It can be edited or submitted.

* **Submitted**: the exception is awaiting a decision. It can no longer be edited.

* **Approved**: the waiver is granted for the defined validity period.

* **Rejected**: the waiver is refused. A rejection reason is mandatory and is visible to the requester. The exception can be corrected and resubmitted.

* **Expired**: an approved exception whose end date has passed is automatically moved to *Expired* status.

!!! note "Traceability"
    Each transition is timestamped and associated with the user who performed it. This information is retained and visible on the [exception details screen](#show), making it possible to justify the waiver during an ISO 27001 audit.
