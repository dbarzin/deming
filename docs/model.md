# **Data Model**

The key tables are the following:

- attributes  
- domains  
- frameworks  
- controls  
- measures  
- documents  
- risks  
- actions  
- exceptions  

> `controls` = **security measures** (requirements to implement).  
> `measures` = **audit instances** (periodic verifications of those requirements).  
> `risks` = **information security risks** (ISO 27001 §6.1.2 register).  
> `actions` = **action plans** (remediation of failed measurements and risks).  
> `exceptions` = **exceptions** (temporary waivers to a security measure).

## **Table Dependencies**

The relationships are as follows:

| Link | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `domains` → `controls` | Foreign key (1:N) | Each security measure references its domain via `domain_id` |
| `frameworks` → `domains` | Optional (1:N) via the code | A domain's `framework` field holds the `code` of its framework; the `frameworks` row adds its metadata |
| `controls` ↔ `measures` | Many-to-many (bidirectional) | Each security measure lists its audit instances in `measures[]`; each audit instance lists its security measures in `controls[]` |
| `attributes` → `controls` | Optional | The `attributes` field of a security measure may contain a list of attribute IDs |
| `attributes` → `measures` | Optional | Same for audit instances |
| `measures` → `measures` | Self-reference via `next_id` | Allows chaining successive campaigns of the same audit |
| `documents` → `measures` | Optional (1:N) | Documents and evidence are attached to audit instances via `measure_id` |
| `risks` ↔ `controls` | Many-to-many via `control_risk` | A mitigated risk must be linked to one or more security controls; the list is stored in `controls[]` on the risk |
| `users` → `risks` | Optional (1:N) | Each risk can be assigned an owner (`owner_id`) responsible for the periodic review |
| `measures` → `actions` | Optional (1:N) | An action plan created when making a measurement references it via `measure_id` |
| `actions` ↔ `controls` | Many-to-many via `action_control` | Security measures (clauses) concerned by the action plan |
| `actions` ↔ `risks` | Many-to-many via `action_risk` | Action plans treating a risk; required for a *Not accepted* risk |
| `actions` ↔ `users` | Many-to-many via `action_user` | Owners of the action plan |
| `controls` → `exceptions` | Optional (1:N) | Each exception references the security measure it waives via `control_id` |
| `users` → `exceptions` | Optional (1:N) | Author (`created_by`), submitter (`submitted_by`) and reviewer (`approved_by`) of the exception |

> **Note:** There is no exposed join table for the controls/measures relationship.  
> IDs are directly embedded in each object on both sides.  
> The `control_risk` pivot table links risks to security controls.  
> The `action_control`, `action_risk` and `action_user` pivot tables link action plans to security measures, risks and owners.

## **attributes**

Attributes are multi-value classification reference sets.  
Each attribute defines a set of tags (prefixed with `#`) that can be associated with security measures and audit instances.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | integer | Unique identifier (PK) |
| `name` | string | Name of the taxonomy (e.g., *Security measures*, *Risk_Level*) |
| `values` | string | List of possible values separated by spaces, each prefixed with `#` (e.g., `#Preventive #Detective #Corrective`) |
| `created_at` | datetime | Creation date (ISO 8601, UTC) |
| `updated_at` | datetime | Last modification date |

Example:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Security measures",
  "values": "#Preventive #Detective #Corrective",
  "created_at": "2026-05-17T20:35:52.000000Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-05-17T20:35:52.000000Z"
}
```

---

## **domains**

Domains group security measures by thematic area.  
Each domain belongs to a regulatory or methodological framework (`framework`).

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | integer | Unique identifier (PK) |
| `framework` | string | Reference framework (e.g., `NIS2`, `Vulnerability Management`) |

  "framework": "NIS2",
  "title": "NIS2 Governance and Steering",
  "description": "Strategic and operational steering according to Art. 21.1 and 21.2.a",
  "created_at": "2026-05-17T20:35:52.000000Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-05-17T20:35:52.000000Z"
}
```

---

## **frameworks**

The `frameworks` table adds metadata to the framework codes used in `domains.framework`. It does not replace that field:
a framework is linked to its domains, and through them to its security measures, by its `code`.
A row is created automatically, with the code as its name, when a domain is saved with a new framework code.
The [crosswalks](crosswalk.md) use these codes to select the source and target frameworks.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | integer | Unique identifier (PK) |
| `code` | string | Framework code, identical to `domains.framework` (unique, e.g., `27001:2022`) |
| `name` | string | Name of the framework (the code by default) |
| `version` | string | Version of the framework (empty by default) |
| `publisher` | string | Publisher of the framework (empty by default) |
| `jurisdiction` | string \| null | Jurisdiction in which the framework applies |
| `source_url` | string \| null | URL of the official source |
| `status` | string \| null | Status of the framework (free text) |
| `publication_date` | date \| null | Publication date |
| `effective_date` | date \| null | Effective date |
| `notes` | string \| null | Free notes |
| `created_at` | datetime | Creation date |
| `updated_at` | datetime | Last modification date |

Example:

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "code": "NIS2-ReCyF-2.5-FR",
  "name": "ReCyF 2.5",
  "version": "2.5",
  "publisher": "ANSSI",
  "jurisdiction": "France",
  "source_url": "https://messervices.cyber.gouv.fr/nis2#exigences",
  "status": null,
  "publication_date": null,
  "effective_date": null,
  "notes": null
}
```

---

## **controls**

| `id` | integer | Unique identifier (PK) |
| `domain_id` | integer | Reference to `domains.id` (FK, required) |

## **actions**

The `actions` table contains the action plans put in place to remedy a failed measurement, a non-conformity or a risk.
An action plan can be created manually or when making a measurement; it is then linked to this measurement via `measure_id`.
